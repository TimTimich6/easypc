Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

Still Need to upgrade the monitor to 1440 or higher but currently playing warzone on maxed graphic settings at 170FPS.

On the mid-tower Evo, with this specific GPU, and cablemod's 12VHPWR cable the cable presses against the glass panel. The recommended 4 - 4.5cm of cable BEFORE the bend is not met. It bends at the cable shroud, so about only 2-3cm.\n-Chosen the 16pin to 2 x 8-pin PCIe cable from Cablemod. Less cable management. I don't think they offer this anymore, but they did when I bought my kit.\n-Gone full Corsair fans, because Lian-li's fan hub and software are garbage. RGB and Fan Control (the program) set-up was a nightmare. Through BIOS I could only get rainbow effect on the Lian-li fans, not static white like I wanted. ASRock RGB software, ASRRGB (Polychrome RGB), crashed when selecting the aRGB connector that the Lian-li hub was plugged into. OpenRGB did not detect Lian-li fan hub. SignalRGB did work, however conflicted with iCue and Fan Control (even the free version was messing with the lian-li fan profile); I'm not paying monthly to resolve this with their built in fan profiling, but probably would have resolved everything with one program for RGB and fan profiles. Lian-Li's Connect 3 is garbage, but eventually I found a janky solution:\nIn BIOS set the chassis fan header the hub is connected to, to PWM mode, Standard profile. Fans default to this on startup and whenever Connect 3 is ran.\nUse Lian-li Connect 3 to sync the fan control to motherboard and use the software to get static white effect (syncing to mobo didn't work fyi). Close it, do not startup on boot.\nUse Fan Control to take control of the fans. Use the Lian-li hub plugin (the non ARGB plugin, the ARGB plugin turns off RGB). Set fan profile and launch on startup.\nUse iCue to set hardware lighting and fan control of the cooler, launch on startup.\nSo I'm stuck with iCue unfortunately. There is a corsair commander hub plugin for Fan Control, however it turns off the RGB, even the hardware lighting. Would have loved to only use Fan Control. It's an amazing program, donated $10, you should too. Really hope the developer releases a similar RGB control program. With this janky solution if I ever flip the PSU switch or the power goes out, I will have to re-open Connect 3 to set the static white effect again. Shutting the PC down with the off switch works fine, the static effect stays.\nBefore building this I was unsure how the single SL-infinity would connect to the hub. The cables provided don't work with the hub as they are the 3pin aRGB and 4 pin chassis, but you can use one of the splitter cables included in the triple pack. This conundrum is why I didn't buy 6 single reverse blade SL-infinity fans and instead bought 2 triple packs.

Ran out of budget, so at the end picked a 13700k, since it is also an \"i9\" technically :)\nThe original cable comes with PSU are ok, but in terms of wire management it is a DISASTER. Most cables are flat and hard to gather together, and the motherboard cable is thicck and hard to bend, the official corsair sleeves cable will make your life way better (other brands are fine but in case of an accident, there\u2019s a larger chance that the retailer will refuse to repair) but if you are a lazy person like me, then this is not an issue :)\nFan configuration: 3 bottom intake, 3 side AIO intake, 3 top exhaust and 1 back exhaust. Intake fans are all LianLi reverse fans. After you mount your AIO on the side of the case, there are plenty of space at the black for you to install the extra fans at the back to make a push-pull. So I do recommend to side mount your AIO when it is possible.\nIf you are planning using both LianLi uni fans and strimmer plus series extension cable, remember to prepare a USB2.0 splitter since most motherboard have only two 2.0 ports. All the price listed are after tax price, a lot of the components were bought during discount event.

With no bloat and spyware from Apple and Microsoft. Also, I didn't want any water-cooling. Done it to death and I don't think it is necessary, especially since I won't overclock anything.\n-Tight fit: Pcpartspicker incorrectly exclaimed that the AMD 7900XT wouldn't fit in the streacom ITX case but it did - kinda. I had to remove the 'sapphire' logo from the card - which was only 2 screws, place the card in, then screw the logo back on. I did have to put the card in before the SSD heatsink, the fans, and noctua CPU cooler. Think I could of fit the bigger noctua CPU cooler in, but with negligible results. In order to get 2 slimline noctua fans above the PSU and mobo to increase hot air expulsion, had to shim the PSU down. Hanging it with mobo stand-offs, the biggest I could find. The PSU to PCIE power cables have way too much strain on them when putting on the steacom DA2 side panel, and that's with the 7900 xt's indented ports. So I had to order right angle/90 degree cablemod power cable. I had to modify the streacom PSU mount bracket with a grinder. Easy 5 min job that would of been easier with a dremel.\n-Temps: Base clocks, the gpu seems to reach an equilibrium @ 69 degree's Celsius. CPU @ 48 I doubt I could upgrade the side panel to the glass panel without heat probs.\n-Silence: ahhh it is barely audible.\nHappy to report that my first AMD gpu works perfectly with arch linux. Literally installed with pacman -S xf86-amdgpu and it has been perfect ever since.\nStill waiting on a spare 140mm noctua fan to go on the side above the GPU which I'll plug into a reduced speed loom.

Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

On the mid-tower Evo, with this specific GPU, and cablemod's 12VHPWR cable the cable presses against the glass panel. The recommended 4 - 4.5cm of cable BEFORE the bend is not met. It bends at the cable shroud, so about only 2-3cm.\n-Chosen the 16pin to 2 x 8-pin PCIe cable from Cablemod. Less cable management. I don't think they offer this anymore, but they did when I bought my kit.\n-Gone full Corsair fans, because Lian-li's fan hub and software are garbage. RGB and Fan Control (the program) set-up was a nightmare. Through BIOS I could only get rainbow effect on the Lian-li fans, not static white like I wanted. ASRock RGB software, ASRRGB (Polychrome RGB), crashed when selecting the aRGB connector that the Lian-li hub was plugged into. OpenRGB did not detect Lian-li fan hub. SignalRGB did work, however conflicted with iCue and Fan Control (even the free version was messing with the lian-li fan profile); I'm not paying monthly to resolve this with their built in fan profiling, but probably would have resolved everything with one program for RGB and fan profiles. Lian-Li's Connect 3 is garbage, but eventually I found a janky solution:\nIn BIOS set the chassis fan header the hub is connected to, to PWM mode, Standard profile. Fans default to this on startup and whenever Connect 3 is ran.\nUse Lian-li Connect 3 to sync the fan control to motherboard and use the software to get static white effect (syncing to mobo didn't work fyi). Close it, do not startup on boot.\nUse Fan Control to take control of the fans. Use the Lian-li hub plugin (the non ARGB plugin, the ARGB plugin turns off RGB). Set fan profile and launch on startup.\nUse iCue to set hardware lighting and fan control of the cooler, launch on startup.\nSo I'm stuck with iCue unfortunately. There is a corsair commander hub plugin for Fan Control, however it turns off the RGB, even the hardware lighting. Would have loved to only use Fan Control. It's an amazing program, donated $10, you should too. Really hope the developer releases a similar RGB control program. With this janky solution if I ever flip the PSU switch or the power goes out, I will have to re-open Connect 3 to set the static white effect again. Shutting the PC down with the off switch works fine, the static effect stays.\nBefore building this I was unsure how the single SL-infinity would connect to the hub. The cables provided don't work with the hub as they are the 3pin aRGB and 4 pin chassis, but you can use one of the splitter cables included in the triple pack. This conundrum is why I didn't buy 6 single reverse blade SL-infinity fans and instead bought 2 triple packs.

Ran out of budget, so at the end picked a 13700k, since it is also an \"i9\" technically :)\nThe original cable comes with PSU are ok, but in terms of wire management it is a DISASTER. Most cables are flat and hard to gather together, and the motherboard cable is thicck and hard to bend, the official corsair sleeves cable will make your life way better (other brands are fine but in case of an accident, there\u2019s a larger chance that the retailer will refuse to repair) but if you are a lazy person like me, then this is not an issue :)\nFan configuration: 3 bottom intake, 3 side AIO intake, 3 top exhaust and 1 back exhaust. Intake fans are all LianLi reverse fans. After you mount your AIO on the side of the case, there are plenty of space at the black for you to install the extra fans at the back to make a push-pull. So I do recommend to side mount your AIO when it is possible.\nIf you are planning using both LianLi uni fans and strimmer plus series extension cable, remember to prepare a USB2.0 splitter since most motherboard have only two 2.0 ports. All the price listed are after tax price, a lot of the components were bought during discount event. (Extremely lucky to get a STRIX 4090 white version for \u201cnearly\u201d the original price since there\u2019s not much left in the market) [/INST] [<CPU> Intel Core i7-13700K 3.4 GHz 16-Core; <GPU> Asus ROG STRIX GAMING OC GeForce RTX 4090 24 GB; <RAM> ADATA XPG LANCER RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL40; <MOBO> Asus ROG STRIX Z790-A GAMING WIFI ATX LGA1700; <PSU> Corsair RM1000e (2023) 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX; <STORAGE> Samsung 980 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME SSD; <CASE> Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO ATX Mid Tower]"}

With no bloat and spyware from Apple and Microsoft. Also, I didn't want any water-cooling. Done it to death and I don't think it is necessary, especially since I won't overclock anything.\n-Tight fit: Pcpartspicker incorrectly exclaimed that the AMD 7900XT wouldn't fit in the streacom ITX case but it did - kinda. I had to remove the 'sapphire' logo from the card - which was only 2 screws, place the card in, then screw the logo back on. I did have to put the card in before the SSD heatsink, the fans, and noctua CPU cooler. Think I could of fit the bigger noctua CPU cooler in, but with negligible results. In order to get 2 slimline noctua fans above the PSU and mobo to increase hot air expulsion, had to shim the PSU down. Hanging it with mobo stand-offs, the biggest I could find. The PSU to PCIE power cables have way too much strain on them when putting on the steacom DA2 side panel, and that's with the 7900 xt's indented ports. So I had to order right angle/90 degree cablemod power cable. I had to modify the streacom PSU mount bracket with a grinder. Easy 5 min job that would of been easier with a dremel.\n-Temps: Base clocks, the gpu seems to reach an equilibrium @ 69 degree's Celsius. CPU @ 48 I doubt I could upgrade the side panel to the glass panel without heat probs.\n-Silence: ahhh it is barely audible.\nHappy to report that my first AMD gpu works perfectly with arch linux. Literally installed with pacman -S xf86-amdgpu and it has been perfect ever since.\nStill waiting on a spare 140mm noctua fan to go on the side above the GPU which I'll plug into a reduced speed loom.

Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

On the mid-tower Evo, with this specific GPU, and cablemod's 12VHPWR cable the cable presses against the glass panel. The recommended 4 - 4.5cm of cable BEFORE the bend is not met. It bends at the cable shroud, so about only 2-3cm.\n-Chosen the 16pin to 2 x 8-pin PCIe cable from Cablemod. Less cable management. I don't think they offer this anymore, but they did when I bought my kit.\n-Gone full Corsair fans, because Lian-li's fan hub and software are garbage. RGB and Fan Control (the program) set-up was a nightmare. Through BIOS I could only get rainbow effect on the Lian-li fans, not static white like I wanted. ASRock RGB software, ASRRGB (Polychrome RGB), crashed when selecting the aRGB connector that the Lian-li hub was plugged into. OpenRGB did not detect Lian-li fan hub. SignalRGB did work, however conflicted with iCue and Fan Control (even the free version was messing with the lian-li fan profile); I'm not paying monthly to resolve this with their built in fan profiling, but probably would have resolved everything with one program for RGB and fan profiles. Lian-Li's Connect 3 is garbage, but eventually I found a janky solution:\nIn BIOS set the chassis fan header the hub is connected to, to PWM mode, Standard profile. Fans default to this on startup and whenever Connect 3 is ran.\nUse Lian-li Connect 3 to sync the fan control to motherboard and use the software to get static white effect (syncing to mobo didn't work fyi). Close it, do not startup on boot.\nUse Fan Control to take control of the fans. Use the Lian-li hub plugin (the non ARGB plugin, the ARGB plugin turns off RGB). Set fan profile and launch on startup.\nUse iCue to set hardware lighting and fan control of the cooler, launch on startup.\nSo I'm stuck with iCue unfortunately. There is a corsair commander hub plugin for Fan Control, however it turns off the RGB, even the hardware lighting. Would have loved to only use Fan Control. It's an amazing program, donated $10, you should too. Really hope the developer releases a similar RGB control program. With this janky solution if I ever flip the PSU switch or the power goes out, I will have to re-open Connect 3 to set the static white effect again. Shutting the PC down with the off switch works fine, the static effect stays.\nBefore building this I was unsure how the single SL-infinity would connect to the hub. The cables provided don't work with the hub as they are the 3pin aRGB and 4 pin chassis, but you can use one of the splitter cables included in the triple pack. This conundrum is why I didn't buy 6 single reverse blade SL-infinity fans and instead bought 2 triple packs.

Ran out of budget, so at the end picked a 13700k, since it is also an \"i9\" technically :)\nThe original cable comes with PSU are ok, but in terms of wire management it is a DISASTER. Most cables are flat and hard to gather together, and the motherboard cable is thicck and hard to bend, the official corsair sleeves cable will make your life way better (other brands are fine but in case of an accident, there\u2019s a larger chance that the retailer will refuse to repair) but if you are a lazy person like me, then this is not an issue :)\nFan configuration: 3 bottom intake, 3 side AIO intake, 3 top exhaust and 1 back exhaust. Intake fans are all LianLi reverse fans. After you mount your AIO on the side of the case, there are plenty of space at the black for you to install the extra fans at the back to make a push-pull. So I do recommend to side mount your AIO when it is possible.\nIf you are planning using both LianLi uni fans and strimmer plus series extension cable, remember to prepare a USB2.0 splitter since most motherboard have only two 2.0 ports. All the price listed are after tax price, a lot of the components were bought during discount event. (Extremely lucky to get a STRIX 4090 white version for \u201cnearly\u201d the original price since there\u2019s not much left in the market) [/INST] [<CPU> Intel Core i7-13700K 3.4 GHz 16-Core; <GPU> Asus ROG STRIX GAMING OC GeForce RTX 4090 24 GB; <RAM> ADATA XPG LANCER RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL40; <MOBO> Asus ROG STRIX Z790-A GAMING WIFI ATX LGA1700; <PSU> Corsair RM1000e (2023) 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX; <STORAGE> Samsung 980 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME SSD; <CASE> Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO ATX Mid Tower]"}

With no bloat and spyware from Apple and Microsoft. Also, I didn't want any water-cooling. Done it to death and I don't think it is necessary, especially since I won't overclock anything.\n-Tight fit: Pcpartspicker incorrectly exclaimed that the AMD 7900XT wouldn't fit in the streacom ITX case but it did - kinda. I had to remove the 'sapphire' logo from the card - which was only 2 screws, place the card in, then screw the logo back on. I did have to put the card in before the SSD heatsink, the fans, and noctua CPU cooler. Think I could of fit the bigger noctua CPU cooler in, but with negligible results. In order to get 2 slimline noctua fans above the PSU and mobo to increase hot air expulsion, had to shim the PSU down. Hanging it with mobo stand-offs, the biggest I could find. The PSU to PCIE power cables have way too much strain on them when putting on the steacom DA2 side panel, and that's with the 7900 xt's indented ports. So I had to order right angle/90 degree cablemod power cable. I had to modify the streacom PSU mount bracket with a grinder. Easy 5 min job that would of been easier with a dremel.\n-Temps: Base clocks, the gpu seems to reach an equilibrium @ 69 degree's Celsius. CPU @ 48 I doubt I could upgrade the side panel to the glass panel without heat probs.\n-Silence: ahhh it is barely audible.\nHappy to report that my first AMD gpu works perfectly with arch linux. Literally installed with pacman -S xf86-amdgpu and it has been perfect ever since.\nStill waiting on a spare 140mm noctua fan to go on the side above the GPU which I'll plug into a reduced speed loom.

Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

On the mid-tower Evo, with this specific GPU, and cablemod's 12VHPWR cable the cable presses against the glass panel. The recommended 4 - 4.5cm of cable BEFORE the bend is not met. It bends at the cable shroud, so about only 2-3cm.\n-Chosen the 16pin to 2 x 8-pin PCIe cable from Cablemod. Less cable management. I don't think they offer this anymore, but they did when I bought my kit.\n-Gone full Corsair fans, because Lian-li's fan hub and software are garbage. RGB and Fan Control (the program) set-up was a nightmare. Through BIOS I could only get rainbow effect on the Lian-li fans, not static white like I wanted. ASRock RGB software, ASRRGB (Polychrome RGB), crashed when selecting the aRGB connector that the Lian-li hub was plugged into. OpenRGB did not detect Lian-li fan hub. SignalRGB did work, however conflicted with iCue and Fan Control (even the free version was messing with the lian-li fan profile); I'm not paying monthly to resolve this with their built in fan profiling, but probably would have resolved everything with one program for RGB and fan profiles. Lian-Li's Connect 3 is garbage, but eventually I found a janky solution:\nIn BIOS set the chassis fan header the hub is connected to, to PWM mode, Standard profile. Fans default to this on startup and whenever Connect 3 is ran.\nUse Lian-li Connect 3 to sync the fan control to motherboard and use the software to get static white effect (syncing to mobo didn't work fyi). Close it, do not startup on boot.\nUse Fan Control to take control of the fans. Use the Lian-li hub plugin (the non ARGB plugin, the ARGB plugin turns off RGB). Set fan profile and launch on startup.\nUse iCue to set hardware lighting and fan control of the cooler, launch on startup.\nSo I'm stuck with iCue unfortunately. There is a corsair commander hub plugin for Fan Control, however it turns off the RGB, even the hardware lighting. Would have loved to only use Fan Control. It's an amazing program, donated $10, you should too. Really hope the developer releases a similar RGB control program. With this janky solution if I ever flip the PSU switch or the power goes out, I will have to re-open Connect 3 to set the static white effect again. Shutting the PC down with the off switch works fine, the static effect stays.\nBefore building this I was unsure how the single SL-infinity would connect to the hub. The cables provided don't work with the hub as they are the 3pin aRGB and 4 pin chassis, but you can use one of the splitter cables included in the triple pack. This conundrum is why I didn't buy 6 single reverse blade SL-infinity fans and instead bought 2 triple packs.

Ran out of budget, so at the end picked a 13700k, since it is also an \"i9\" technically :)\nThe original cable comes with PSU are ok, but in terms of wire management it is a DISASTER. Most cables are flat and hard to gather together, and the motherboard cable is thicck and hard to bend, the official corsair sleeves cable will make your life way better (other brands are fine but in case of an accident, there\u2019s a larger chance that the retailer will refuse to repair) but if you are a lazy person like me, then this is not an issue :)\nFan configuration: 3 bottom intake, 3 side AIO intake, 3 top exhaust and 1 back exhaust. Intake fans are all LianLi reverse fans. After you mount your AIO on the side of the case, there are plenty of space at the black for you to install the extra fans at the back to make a push-pull. So I do recommend to side mount your AIO when it is possible.\nIf you are planning using both LianLi uni fans and strimmer plus series extension cable, remember to prepare a USB2.0 splitter since most motherboard have only two 2.0 ports. All the price listed are after tax price, a lot of the components were bought during discount event. (Extremely lucky to get a STRIX 4090 white version for \u201cnearly\u201d the original price since there\u2019s not much left in the market) [/INST] [<CPU> Intel Core i7-13700K 3.4 GHz 16-Core; <GPU> Asus ROG STRIX GAMING OC GeForce RTX 4090 24 GB; <RAM> ADATA XPG LANCER RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL40; <MOBO> Asus ROG STRIX Z790-A GAMING WIFI ATX LGA1700; <PSU> Corsair RM1000e (2023) 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX; <STORAGE> Samsung 980 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME SSD; <CASE> Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO ATX Mid Tower]"}

With no bloat and spyware from Apple and Microsoft. Also, I didn't want any water-cooling. Done it to death and I don't think it is necessary, especially since I won't overclock anything.\n-Tight fit: Pcpartspicker incorrectly exclaimed that the AMD 7900XT wouldn't fit in the streacom ITX case but it did - kinda. I had to remove the 'sapphire' logo from the card - which was only 2 screws, place the card in, then screw the logo back on. I did have to put the card in before the SSD heatsink, the fans, and noctua CPU cooler. Think I could of fit the bigger noctua CPU cooler in, but with negligible results. In order to get 2 slimline noctua fans above the PSU and mobo to increase hot air expulsion, had to shim the PSU down. Hanging it with mobo stand-offs, the biggest I could find. The PSU to PCIE power cables have way too much strain on them when putting on the steacom DA2 side panel, and that's with the 7900 xt's indented ports. So I had to order right angle/90 degree cablemod power cable. I had to modify the streacom PSU mount bracket with a grinder. Easy 5 min job that would of been easier with a dremel.\n-Temps: Base clocks, the gpu seems to reach an equilibrium @ 69 degree's Celsius. CPU @ 48 I doubt I could upgrade the side panel to the glass panel without heat probs.\n-Silence: ahhh it is barely audible.\nHappy to report that my first AMD gpu works perfectly with arch linux. Literally installed with pacman -S xf86-amdgpu and it has been perfect ever since.\nStill waiting on a spare 140mm noctua fan to go on the side above the GPU which I'll plug into a reduced speed loom.

Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

On the mid-tower Evo, with this specific GPU, and cablemod's 12VHPWR cable the cable presses against the glass panel. The recommended 4 - 4.5cm of cable BEFORE the bend is not met. It bends at the cable shroud, so about only 2-3cm.\n-Chosen the 16pin to 2 x 8-pin PCIe cable from Cablemod. Less cable management. I don't think they offer this anymore, but they did when I bought my kit.\n-Gone full Corsair fans, because Lian-li's fan hub and software are garbage. RGB and Fan Control (the program) set-up was a nightmare. Through BIOS I could only get rainbow effect on the Lian-li fans, not static white like I wanted. ASRock RGB software, ASRRGB (Polychrome RGB), crashed when selecting the aRGB connector that the Lian-li hub was plugged into. OpenRGB did not detect Lian-li fan hub. SignalRGB did work, however conflicted with iCue and Fan Control (even the free version was messing with the lian-li fan profile); I'm not paying monthly to resolve this with their built in fan profiling, but probably would have resolved everything with one program for RGB and fan profiles. Lian-Li's Connect 3 is garbage, but eventually I found a janky solution:\nIn BIOS set the chassis fan header the hub is connected to, to PWM mode, Standard profile. Fans default to this on startup and whenever Connect 3 is ran.\nUse Lian-li Connect 3 to sync the fan control to motherboard and use the software to get static white effect (syncing to mobo didn't work fyi). Close it, do not startup on boot.\nUse Fan Control to take control of the fans. Use the Lian-li hub plugin (the non ARGB plugin, the ARGB plugin turns off RGB). Set fan profile and launch on startup.\nUse iCue to set hardware lighting and fan control of the cooler, launch on startup.\nSo I'm stuck with iCue unfortunately. There is a corsair commander hub plugin for Fan Control, however it turns off the RGB, even the hardware lighting. Would have loved to only use Fan Control. It's an amazing program, donated $10, you should too. Really hope the developer releases a similar RGB control program. With this janky solution if I ever flip the PSU switch or the power goes out, I will have to re-open Connect 3 to set the static white effect again. Shutting the PC down with the off switch works fine, the static effect stays.\nBefore building this I was unsure how the single SL-infinity would connect to the hub. The cables provided don't work with the hub as they are the 3pin aRGB and 4 pin chassis, but you can use one of the splitter cables included in the triple pack. This conundrum is why I didn't buy 6 single reverse blade SL-infinity fans and instead bought 2 triple packs.

Ran out of budget, so at the end picked a 13700k, since it is also an \"i9\" technically :)\nThe original cable comes with PSU are ok, but in terms of wire management it is a DISASTER. Most cables are flat and hard to gather together, and the motherboard cable is thicck and hard to bend, the official corsair sleeves cable will make your life way better (other brands are fine but in case of an accident, there\u2019s a larger chance that the retailer will refuse to repair) but if you are a lazy person like me, then this is not an issue :)\nFan configuration: 3 bottom intake, 3 side AIO intake, 3 top exhaust and 1 back exhaust. Intake fans are all LianLi reverse fans. After you mount your AIO on the side of the case, there are plenty of space at the black for you to install the extra fans at the back to make a push-pull. So I do recommend to side mount your AIO when it is possible.\nIf you are planning using both LianLi uni fans and strimmer plus series extension cable, remember to prepare a USB2.0 splitter since most motherboard have only two 2.0 ports. All the price listed are after tax price, a lot of the components were bought during discount event. (Extremely lucky to get a STRIX 4090 white version for \u201cnearly\u201d the original price since there\u2019s not much left in the market) [/INST] [<CPU> Intel Core i7-13700K 3.4 GHz 16-Core; <GPU> Asus ROG STRIX GAMING OC GeForce RTX 4090 24 GB; <RAM> ADATA XPG LANCER RGB 32 GB (2 x 16 GB) DDR5-6000 CL40; <MOBO> Asus ROG STRIX Z790-A GAMING WIFI ATX LGA1700; <PSU> Corsair RM1000e (2023) 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX; <STORAGE> Samsung 980 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME SSD; <CASE> Lian Li O11 Dynamic EVO ATX Mid Tower]"}

With no bloat and spyware from Apple and Microsoft. Also, I didn't want any water-cooling. Done it to death and I don't think it is necessary, especially since I won't overclock anything.\n-Tight fit: Pcpartspicker incorrectly exclaimed that the AMD 7900XT wouldn't fit in the streacom ITX case but it did - kinda. I had to remove the 'sapphire' logo from the card - which was only 2 screws, place the card in, then screw the logo back on. I did have to put the card in before the SSD heatsink, the fans, and noctua CPU cooler. Think I could of fit the bigger noctua CPU cooler in, but with negligible results. In order to get 2 slimline noctua fans above the PSU and mobo to increase hot air expulsion, had to shim the PSU down. Hanging it with mobo stand-offs, the biggest I could find. The PSU to PCIE power cables have way too much strain on them when putting on the steacom DA2 side panel, and that's with the 7900 xt's indented ports. So I had to order right angle/90 degree cablemod power cable. I had to modify the streacom PSU mount bracket with a grinder. Easy 5 min job that would of been easier with a dremel.\n-Temps: Base clocks, the gpu seems to reach an equilibrium @ 69 degree's Celsius. CPU @ 48 I doubt I could upgrade the side panel to the glass panel without heat probs.\n-Silence: ahhh it is barely audible.\nHappy to report that my first AMD gpu works perfectly with arch linux. Literally installed with pacman -S xf86-amdgpu and it has been perfect ever since.\nStill waiting on a spare 140mm noctua fan to go on the side above the GPU which I'll plug into a reduced speed loom.

Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

On the mid-tower Evo, with this specific GPU, and cablemod's 12VHPWR cable the cable presses against the glass panel. The recommended 4 - 4.5cm of cable BEFORE the bend is not met. It bends at the cable shroud, so about only 2-3cm.\n-Chosen the 16pin to 2 x 8-pin PCIe cable from Cablemod. Less cable management. I don't think they offer this anymore, but they did when I bought my kit.\n-Gone full Corsair fans, because Lian-li's fan hub and software are garbage. RGB and Fan Control (the program) set-up was a nightmare. Through BIOS I could only get rainbow effect on the Lian-li fans, not static white like I wanted. ASRock RGB software, ASRRGB (Polychrome RGB), crashed when selecting the aRGB connector that the Lian-li hub was plugged into. OpenRGB did not detect Lian-li fan hub. SignalRGB did work, however conflicted with iCue and Fan Control (even the free version was messing with the lian-li fan profile); I'm not paying monthly to resolve this with their built in fan profiling, but probably would have resolved everything with one program for RGB and fan profiles. Lian-Li's Connect 3 is garbage, but eventually I found a janky solution:\nIn BIOS set the chassis fan header the hub is connected to, to PWM mode, Standard profile. Fans default to this on startup and whenever Connect 3 is ran.\nUse Lian-li Connect 3 to sync the fan control to motherboard and use the software to get static white effect (syncing to mobo didn't work fyi). Close it, do not startup on boot.\nUse Fan Control to take control of the fans. Use the Lian-li hub plugin (the non ARGB plugin, the ARGB plugin turns off RGB). Set fan profile and launch on startup.\nUse iCue to set hardware lighting and fan control of the cooler, launch on startup.\nSo I'm stuck with iCue unfortunately. There is a corsair commander hub plugin for Fan Control, however it turns off the RGB, even the hardware lighting. Would have loved to only use Fan Control. It's an amazing program, donated $10, you should too. Really hope the developer releases a similar RGB control program. With this janky solution if I ever flip the PSU switch or the power goes out, I will have to re-open Connect 3 to set the static white effect again. Shutting the PC down with the off switch works fine, the static effect stays.\nBefore building this I was unsure how the single SL-infinity would connect to the hub. The cables provided don't work with the hub as they are the 3pin aRGB and 4 pin chassis, but you can use one of the splitter cables included in the triple pack. This conundrum is why I didn't buy 6 single reverse blade SL-infinity fans and instead bought 2 triple packs.

Ran out of budget, so at the end picked a 13700k, since it is also an \"i9\" technically :)\nThe original cable comes with PSU are ok, but in terms of wire management it is a DISASTER. Most cables are flat and hard to gather together, and the motherboard cable is thicck and hard to bend, the official corsair sleeves cable will make your life way better (other brands are fine but in case of an accident, there\u2019s a larger chance that the retailer will refuse to repair) but if you are a lazy person like me, then this is not an issue :)\nFan configuration: 3 bottom intake, 3 side AIO intake, 3 top exhaust and 1 back exhaust. Intake fans are all LianLi reverse fans. After you mount your AIO on the side of the case, there are plenty of space at the black for you to install the extra fans at the back to make a push-pull. So I do recommend to side mount your AIO when it is possible.\nIf you are planning using both LianLi uni fans and strimmer plus series extension cable, remember to prepare a USB2.0 splitter since most motherboard have only two 2.0 ports. All the price listed are after tax price, a lot of the components were bought during discount event.

With no bloat and spyware from Apple and Microsoft. Also, I didn't want any water-cooling. Done it to death and I don't think it is necessary, especially since I won't overclock anything.\n-Tight fit: Pcpartspicker incorrectly exclaimed that the AMD 7900XT wouldn't fit in the streacom ITX case but it did - kinda. I had to remove the 'sapphire' logo from the card - which was only 2 screws, place the card in, then screw the logo back on. I did have to put the card in before the SSD heatsink, the fans, and noctua CPU cooler. Think I could of fit the bigger noctua CPU cooler in, but with negligible results. In order to get 2 slimline noctua fans above the PSU and mobo to increase hot air expulsion, had to shim the PSU down. Hanging it with mobo stand-offs, the biggest I could find. The PSU to PCIE power cables have way too much strain on them when putting on the steacom DA2 side panel, and that's with the 7900 xt's indented ports. So I had to order right angle/90 degree cablemod power cable. I had to modify the streacom PSU mount bracket with a grinder. Easy 5 min job that would of been easier with a dremel.\n-Temps: Base clocks, the gpu seems to reach an equilibrium @ 69 degree's Celsius. CPU @ 48 I doubt I could upgrade the side panel to the glass panel without heat probs.\n-Silence: ahhh it is barely audible.\nHappy to report that my first AMD gpu works perfectly with arch linux. Literally installed with pacman -S xf86-amdgpu and it has been perfect ever since.\nStill waiting on a spare 140mm noctua fan to go on the side above the GPU which I'll plug into a reduced speed loom.

Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

On the mid-tower Evo, with this specific GPU, and cablemod's 12VHPWR cable the cable presses against the glass panel. The recommended 4 - 4.5cm of cable BEFORE the bend is not met. It bends at the cable shroud, so about only 2-3cm.\n-Chosen the 16pin to 2 x 8-pin PCIe cable from Cablemod. Less cable management. I don't think they offer this anymore, but they did when I bought my kit.\n-Gone full Corsair fans, because Lian-li's fan hub and software are garbage. RGB and Fan Control (the program) set-up was a nightmare. Through BIOS I could only get rainbow effect on the Lian-li fans, not static white like I wanted. ASRock RGB software, ASRRGB (Polychrome RGB), crashed when selecting the aRGB connector that the Lian-li hub was plugged into. OpenRGB did not detect Lian-li fan hub. SignalRGB did work, however conflicted with iCue and Fan Control (even the free version was messing with the lian-li fan profile); I'm not paying monthly to resolve this with their built in fan profiling, but probably would have resolved everything with one program for RGB and fan profiles. Lian-Li's Connect 3 is garbage, but eventually I found a janky solution:\nIn BIOS set the chassis fan header the hub is connected to, to PWM mode, Standard profile. Fans default to this on startup and whenever Connect 3 is ran.\nUse Lian-li Connect 3 to sync the fan control to motherboard and use the software to get static white effect (syncing to mobo didn't work fyi). Close it, do not startup on boot.\nUse Fan Control to take control of the fans. Use the Lian-li hub plugin (the non ARGB plugin, the ARGB plugin turns off RGB). Set fan profile and launch on startup.\nUse iCue to set hardware lighting and fan control of the cooler, launch on startup.\nSo I'm stuck with iCue unfortunately. There is a corsair commander hub plugin for Fan Control, however it turns off the RGB, even the hardware lighting. Would have loved to only use Fan Control. It's an amazing program, donated $10, you should too. Really hope the developer releases a similar RGB control program. With this janky solution if I ever flip the PSU switch or the power goes out, I will have to re-open Connect 3 to set the static white effect again. Shutting the PC down with the off switch works fine, the static effect stays.\nBefore building this I was unsure how the single SL-infinity would connect to the hub. The cables provided don't work with the hub as they are the 3pin aRGB and 4 pin chassis, but you can use one of the splitter cables included in the triple pack. This conundrum is why I didn't buy 6 single reverse blade SL-infinity fans and instead bought 2 triple packs.

Ran out of budget, so at the end picked a 13700k, since it is also an \"i9\" technically :)\nThe original cable comes with PSU are ok, but in terms of wire management it is a DISASTER. Most cables are flat and hard to gather together, and the motherboard cable is thicck and hard to bend, the official corsair sleeves cable will make your life way better (other brands are fine but in case of an accident, there\u2019s a larger chance that the retailer will refuse to repair) but if you are a lazy person like me, then this is not an issue :)\nFan configuration: 3 bottom intake, 3 side AIO intake, 3 top exhaust and 1 back exhaust. Intake fans are all LianLi reverse fans. After you mount your AIO on the side of the case, there are plenty of space at the black for you to install the extra fans at the back to make a push-pull. So I do recommend to side mount your AIO when it is possible.\nIf you are planning using both LianLi uni fans and strimmer plus series extension cable, remember to prepare a USB2.0 splitter since most motherboard have only two 2.0 ports.

With no bloat and spyware from Apple and Microsoft. Also, I didn't want any water-cooling. Done it to death and I don't think it is necessary, especially since I won't overclock anything.\n-Tight fit: Pcpartspicker incorrectly exclaimed that the AMD 7900XT wouldn't fit in the streacom ITX case but it did - kinda. I had to remove the 'sapphire' logo from the card - which was only 2 screws, place the card in, then screw the logo back on. I did have to put the card in before the SSD heatsink, the fans, and noctua CPU cooler. Think I could of fit the bigger noctua CPU cooler in, but with negligible results. In order to get 2 slimline noctua fans above the PSU and mobo to increase hot air expulsion, had to shim the PSU down. Hanging it with mobo stand-offs, the biggest I could find. The PSU to PCIE power cables have way too much strain on them when putting on the steacom DA2 side panel, and that's with the 7900 xt's indented ports. So I had to order right angle/90 degree cablemod power cable. I had to modify the streacom PSU mount bracket with a grinder. Easy 5 min job that would of been easier with a dremel.\n-Temps: Base clocks, the gpu seems to reach an equilibrium @ 69 degree's Celsius. CPU @ 48 I doubt I could upgrade the side panel to the glass panel without heat probs.\n-Silence: ahhh it is barely audible.\nHappy to report that my first AMD gpu works perfectly with arch linux. Literally installed with pacman -S xf86-amdgpu and it has been perfect ever since.\nStill waiting on a spare 140mm noctua fan to go on the side above the GPU which I'll plug into a reduced speed loom.

Got to teach her how one is put together. I guess I didn't realize that the mobo didn't come with wifi so there is a wifi card on the way. Just running a stock cooler. It's actually the stock cooler for an i9 so maybe will do a bit better than the one the i5 came with. We shall see soon enough plus it has RGB. I would've preferred a higher W PSU especially for future upgrades but we saved some money since I just had this one already. Our friends gave us the GPU as well so we were able to make a pretty strong computer for relatively cheap. I really liked this case. It was very easy to work in although we had a screw snap but should be good once I drill it out. The corsair fans are the fans from an aio liquid cooler from a previous build where I went with different fans for it. Turns out they have some unique rgb connector so they don't have rgb at the moment. I was able to find an adapter but it is coming from China so we won't get that for a few weeks but hopefully that will work. Couldn't add it to my part list the easy way but here is the link https://www.newegg.com/p/1W7-00RP-000N6?Item=9SIAGFHHDG4933. Maybe that will help someone else who is dealing with the same issue or maybe someone knows this won't work and will maybe save me from frying components. We're upgrading her from Ryzen 7 2700 and Radeon RX 580. They were performing relatively fine but the system kept crashing. I think I'd struggle to sell it or the components for it to be worthwhile so I think I'll turn it into a NAS for my parents and put the GPU in the system I made them earlier this year. Overall this build was fun and I think it came together pretty well.

I'm gonna call it first, someone's gonna scream blasphemy for pairing a 5600X with a 3090. Just know that I'm as broke as it comes, but a 5800X3D is in line soon.\nI scored a deal on a beautiful Asus Evangelion Edition 3090. Lots of people don't like the green/purple color scheme but I find myself liking it. As much as I wanted the rest of the Eva parts, I really can't find myself justifying $400 for a case, $400 for an AIO, $400 for a PSU, etc... this 3090 was scooped for $900 off cash used in marketplace. I figure it has some resale value in it.\nMy previous power supply and case didn't stand a chance with the 3090, so I had to upgrade those as well. The Lian Li was picked up from my local Micro Center for $103 open box while the CX750M was $75. Great prices and I'm impressed with the Lian Li's ease of use. Looks great too.\nRebuilding the whole thing wasn't so bad. There was a bit of daisy chaining involved but it wasn't particularly tough. Most of the stuff that was on the motherboard before could stay on the motherboard. Took about 2 hours to move everything over and clean up after.

I've just wrapped up my latest build and thought I'd share some insights into my component choices.\n1. CPU: AMD 7950X\nUpgradability: AMD has a history of supporting sockets across multiple generations.\nAM5 Platform Advantages: It can run two PCIe 5.0 devices (both GPU and SSD) at full x16 speed simultaneously. Intel, on the other hand, splits the lanes to x8 each.\nInstallation Ease: Recent Intel CPUs (Gen 12, 13, and 14) require a contact frame for installation. While this frame is primarily meant for better temperature control, it's not only tricky to install, but a misstep could also damage the motherboard.\n2. Motherboard: Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero\nMemory Upgrade Potential: This motherboard has a reputation for seamlessly supporting up to 192GB of memory at 5200MHz. An attractive option for possible future expansions.\nDual GPU Support: I might delve into demanding AI applications in the future that would benefit from two GPUs.\n3. Memory: Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 CL30 (2 x 48 GB)\nPurpose: For AI-centric tasks, both memory capacity and speed are paramount. A setup with 196GB configuration can only attain a maximum frequency of 5200MHz. I selected a 96GB configuration, as this setup permits higher frequencies.\nHigh-Speed Performance: On the AM5 platform, a dual RAM module setup can achieve max. 6000MHz in 1:1 mode (UCLK:MCLK ratio) without requiring any tweaks. This Corsair kit is currently the kit with the fastest timings \"straight-out-of-the-box\".\n4. CPU Cooler: Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance\nTop-Tier Performance: It's hailed as the best-performing CPU AIO currently available. Although it can get loud at full speed, it offers a notable reduction in noise under \"low\" fan setting (reduced max. RPM) without compromising much on performance. Even under \"low\" fan setting, I find the max RPM speed a bit loud, but under normal operation the fan usually doesn't reach its loudest RPM and remains relatively quiet.\n5. SSD: Samsung Pro 990 (4TB)\nVast Storage and Reliability: Not only does it offer ample space, but it also features the latest firmware, safeguarding against the self-degradation issue.\n6. GPU: Gigabyte AORUS Master RTX 4090\nNoise & Performance: It's among the rare models without coil whine, offering robust cooling and being relatively quite under operation.\n7. Thermal Paste: Arctic MX-6\nPerformance & Longevity: While there's a limited number of reviews currently, existing ones rank it amongst top-tier thermal pastes. There is also some experience that it has less \"pump-out\" effect and doesn't try out so quickly than competitors.\n8. Case: Lian Li LANCOOL III (Non-RGB)\nAirflow & Future Expansion: Opted for non-RGB version whose fans have better airflow. The case ranks highly in benchmarks for performance. However, adding another GPU in the future might necessitate a more spacious case (Fractal Meshify 2XL or Corsair 7000D).\n9. Power Supply: be quiet! Straight Power 12 (1200W)\nQuality & Efficiency: be quiet! is renowned for its build quality. The 1200W PSU also has some headroom to ensure energy efficiency when not maxed out. A secondary GPU might, however, call for an upgrade to 1500W.\n10. Fan: Lian Li Uni Fan P28\nBalance of Noise & Performance: As one of the best-performing 120mm fans, it strikes an excellent balance between noise and airflow.

Had to replace the AIO through warranty due to the AN fittings leaking which is not supposed to happen. Corsair was great with the exchange. Still Need to upgrade the monitor to 1440 or higher but currently playing warzone on maxed graphic settings at 170FPS. Corsair could do better with the cable management for the 7000x. for being such a big tower it should been easier to cable manage then it was. great looking tower though [/INST] [<CPU> Intel Core i9-13900K 3 GHz 24-Core; <GPU> Asus TUF GAMING OC GeForce RTX 4080 16 GB; <RAM> G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) DDR5-6400 CL32; <MOBO> Asus TUF GAMING Z790-PLUS WIFI ATX LGA1700; <PSU> Corsair RM1000x (2021) 1000 W 80+ Gold Certified Fully Modular ATX; <STORAGE> Samsung 990 Pro 2 TB M.2-2280 PCIe 4.0 X4 NVME SSD; <CASE> Corsair iCUE 7000X RGB ATX Full Tower]"}
